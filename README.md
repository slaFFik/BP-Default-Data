# BuddyPress Default Data

Plugin will create 25 new users, hundreds of messages (within threads), friends connections, groups, topics, activity items, profile data - useful for testing purpose.

## Description

All imported users will have avatars, generated by 8biticon.com and displayed by Gravatar.

Please use this plugin with caution and not on a live site! Again, USE FOR TESTING THEMES AND PLUGINGS, NOT ON A STAGING SITE WITH LIVE DATA. Plugin should not mess with your live data, but not guaranteed.

Clear BuddyPress button will delete all data, that was generated by this plugin: messages, groups, notifications, friends, forum posts, xprofile. Plugin won't reimport data if clicked twice.

And turn off email notifications in profile (friendship accepted and messages received) - or you will spam yourself :) Imported users have these settings already turned off.
