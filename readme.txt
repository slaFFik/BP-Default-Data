== Description ==

Plugin will create lots of users, messages, friends connections, groups, topics, activity items - useful for testing purpose.

Please use this plugin with caution and not on a live site!

Clear BuddyPress button will truncate tables: messages, groups, notifications, friends and forum posts. All users except one with ID=1 and all corresponding data (usermeta, activity etc) will be deleted too.

And turn off email notifications in profile - or you will spam yourself :)

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder `/bp-default-data/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Default Data page under BuddyPress menu and do what you want.
